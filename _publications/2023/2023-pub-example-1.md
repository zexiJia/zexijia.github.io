abstract: >-
  We address semantic segmentation using only event-based cameras, which operate in
  microseconds and remain robust under challenging lighting. To better exploit event
  information, we propose a posterior attention module that adjusts standard attention
  with priors derived from events and can be plugged into existing segmentation
  backbones. Integrated with SegFormer, the resulting EvSegFormer achieves
  state-of-the-art performance on MVSEC and DDD-17 for event-based semantic
  segmentation, demonstrating both accuracy and efficiency.
