abstract: >-
  We address fingerprint recognition in complex and uncontrolled real-world scenarios,
  where severe distortions, background clutter, and cross-sensor variations often
  break traditional pipelines. We propose OffieNet, a robust fingerprint matching
  framework that combines global–local feature modeling with an offset-invariant
  matching strategy, enabling reliable correspondence even under large deformations
  and background interference. Extensive experiments on multiple in-the-wild
  benchmarks show that OffieNet significantly improves both accuracy and robustness
  over existing fingerprint recognition methods, and has been deployed in a
  next-generation national fingerprint recognition system.
