abstract: >-
  We propose Finger Recovery Transformer (FingerRT), a transformer-based framework
  specifically designed for incomplete fingerprint identification. FingerRT combines
  fingerprint enhancement networks with a two-stage architecture—denoising/enhancement
  and recovery—and incorporates key domain features such as orientation fields and
  minutiae as supervision signals. By imposing multi-level constraints on features,
  images, and generation stages, FingerRT effectively removes ambient noise, restores
  missing ridge structures, and significantly improves recognition accuracy on rolled,
  snapped, and latent fingerprint datasets.
