abstract: >-
  We study copyright infringement detection from a structural perspective and propose
  a framework that learns structure-aware representations to distinguish subtle yet
  significant structural similarities between AI-generated and reference images.
  Starting from semantic features, we progressively refine them into structural
  representations that emphasize layout and geometry, and design a structure-guided
  matching module for infringement judgment. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show
  that our method achieves superior performance, especially in hard structural
  infringement cases.
