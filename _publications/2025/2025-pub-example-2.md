  We introduce MCID, a new task for multi-aspect copyright infringement detection in
  AI-generated images that jointly considers content, style, structure, and intellectual
  property infringement. To support this task, we construct the Large-scale Copyright
  Dataset (LSCD) and propose HIDM, a hybrid infringement detection model that combines
  feature-based similarity analysis with vision-language models. HIDM provides
  interpretable judgments and achieves significantly better performance than existing
  methods across all infringement types, especially on challenging structural cases.:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
