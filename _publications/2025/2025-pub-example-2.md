  We study when AI-generated artworks can be recognized as having their own protectable
  artistic styles and how to judge potential copyright infringement. Building on legal
  precedents, we formulate three key criteria—stylistic consistency, creative uniqueness,
  and expressive accuracy—and propose ArtBulb, an interpretable framework that combines
  a style description-based multimodal clustering method with multimodal large language
  models. We also construct AICD, the first benchmark dataset for AI art copyright
  judgment, and show that ArtBulb outperforms existing methods in both quantitative and
  qualitative evaluations.
