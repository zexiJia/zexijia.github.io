abstract: >-
  We propose a color-distribution-based framework for detecting AI-generated images.
  By analyzing the differences before and after color quantization and restoration,
  we extract lightweight color features and combine them with image features to
  build a 1.4M-parameter detector that achieves state-of-the-art performance on
  multiple benchmarks, including our new and challenging FakeART dataset.
