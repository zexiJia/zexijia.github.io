abstract: >-
  We propose a block-based diffusion framework that automatically generates
  high-quality counterfactual image–text sets to improve CLIP-style compositional
  reasoning. Large language models are used to parse entities and spatial
  relationships, and then guide a “puzzle piece” generation process to compose
  diverse counterfactual images with precisely controlled variations. Together with
  a new set-wise loss that separates intra-set and inter-set pairs, our method
  significantly boosts visual reasoning performance and achieves state-of-the-art
  results on multiple benchmarks while using substantially less training data.
