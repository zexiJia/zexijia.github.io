abstract: >-
  We propose an automated framework for extracting and restoring fingerprint minutiae
  from low-quality images. By jointly enhancing degraded fingerprints and recovering
  missing or unreliable minutiae, the framework improves the robustness of minutiae
  extraction in challenging conditions and boosts subsequent fingerprint recognition
  performance on low-quality and noisy fingerprint datasets.
