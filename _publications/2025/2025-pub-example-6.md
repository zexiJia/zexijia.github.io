  We introduce ArtFRD, a Fisher–Rao mixture metric for evaluating the aesthetic
  quality of images generated by generative models. By modeling aesthetic feature
  distributions on an information-geometric manifold and measuring Fisher–Rao
  distances between generated and real images, ArtFRD jointly captures both visual
  quality and diversity. Experiments on multiple generative models show that
  ArtFRD provides a more faithful and stable approximation to human aesthetic
  judgments than traditional distributional metrics.
