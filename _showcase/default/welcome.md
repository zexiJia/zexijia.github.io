    <h2>Welcome to Collections!</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
        Hi, I'm <strong>Zexi</strong> — a researcher who loves beautiful ideas, clean code, 
        noisy fingerprints, and even noisier concerts.
    </p>
    <p>
        This <code>Collections</code> page is my little corner outside formal papers and CVs. 
        Here I collect moments from work and life: snapshots from conferences, small weekend projects, 
        notes from late-night experiments, travel photos, and random things that made me smile.
    </p>
    <p>
        My motto is:
        <br/>
        <em>“Try again. Fail again. Fail better.”</em>
        <br/>
        把每一次失败都当成向前迈半步——无论是在调不收敛的模型里，还是在做不熟练的菜里。
        If something doesn’t work, I tweak it, laugh at it, and try one more time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some cards here will be about <strong>research</strong> (behind-the-scenes stories, sketches, and demos),
        some about <strong>life</strong> (music, coffee, cities, and small happiness),
        and some are just for fun. Think of it as a living scrapbook of a life 
        that enjoys both science and the world outside the lab.
    </p>
