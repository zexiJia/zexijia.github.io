  <p>
    I am a Senior Algorithm Researcher at
    <a href="https://www.tencent.com/" target="_blank">Tencent WeChat AI</a>,
    working on multimodal large language models and AI-generated content (AIGC) safety.
    My research interests include multimodal learning and vision-language models,
    AIGC safety and copyright protection, and biometric recognition.
  </p>
  <p>
    Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. in Intelligent Science (Machine Vision) from
    <a href="https://www.pku.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Peking University</a>, and my M.Sc. in
    Computer Science (Computer Vision) and B.Eng. in Software Engineering (Data Mining)
    from <a href="https://www.fudan.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Fudan University</a>.
    I have published first-author and corresponding-author papers in top venues such as
    CVPR, ICCV, IEEE TIP and IEEE TIFS, and worked on large-scale systems ranging from
    national fingerprint recognition to multimodal foundation models and AIGC safety.
